# COBOL
Why did I think this was a good idea?

I've first implemented a Python version as a verification to ensure I god the right logic and to verify my results.

Then I got started with Cobol. I used GNU Cobol as an implementation.

The one thing I do like about cobol is the build in parsing of input files.

But I definitly wouldn't mind not touching cobol ever again.
Part just because of the outdated code styles, while most other languages have moved much closer to C.

But also because of the way programs work with the global working memory, input output sections, so on and so on.
