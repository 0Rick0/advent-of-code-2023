# Advent of Code 2023
This repo will track my code for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Day 1 - Trebuchet?!
Implemented in Python.

Interesting was that some numbers could be combined, e.g. oneight.

Went for a quick and dirty implementation, just using string replaces and filters.

## Day 2 - Cube Conundrum
Implemented in Zig.

Was mainly learning how to use Zig.
Part 1 and 2 are implemented in separate commits.

## Day 3 - Gear Ratios
Implemented in Java.

Chose for a language I was familiar with as I didn't have the time to do learn a different language today.

Was stuck for a bit on a simple bit of logic. (Was checking for symbols a bit too far).

Implemented parsing logic in a package and solved the questions in the main class.
The parsing logic was already sufficient after the first challenge that no logic needed to change for the second challenge.

## Day 4 - Scratchcards
Implemented in Scala

This was a language I wanted to have a proper look at for quite a while.
I do like the match statement and the power it gives you. Especially in assignment/returning.
