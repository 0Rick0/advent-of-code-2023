# Advent of Code 2023
This repo will track my code for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Day 1 - Trebuchet?!
Implemented in Python.
Interesting was that some numbers could be combined, e.g. oneight.

Went for a quick and dirty implementation, just using string replaces and filters.
